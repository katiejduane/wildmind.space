**about**

i haven't had a personal website in years. i'm busy with work and a million essays and paintings, but you know, rome wasn't built in a day.

i used gatsby's starter blog as a jumping off point, with plans to reconfigure a lot (most?) of it, add additional functionality, and add static pages for my writing and visual arts portfolios. i'll try to update the blog with fascinating tales when i can. colors, fonts, layout, navigation (well, there isn't any, yet), it will all change. slowly, slowly.

❤️
