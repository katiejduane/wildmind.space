Let's start out with the nitty-gritty:

**Books I want to read this February:**

1. **Kafka on the Shore**, by Haruki Murakami
2. **Meditations**, by Marcus Aurelius
3. **On the Shortness of Life,** by Seneca
4. **Thinking About Memoir**, by Abigail Thomas
5. **A Solemn Pleasure**, by Melissa Pritchard
6. **Mendocino Fire**, by Elizabeth Tallent
7. **Gathering Moss**, by  Robin Wall Kimmerer
8. **The Pocket Pema Chödron**, by Pema Chödron
9. **No Mud, No Lotus**, by Thich Nhat Hanh

\* Bonus Books (I'm doubtful I'll get to them but I'll try, otherwise they'll go to the March list), : **Arctic Dreams** by Barry Lopez, **Braiding Sweetgrass** by Robin Wall Kimmerer, and **A Short History of Nearly Everything**, by Bill Bryson, **Writing Down the Bones,** by Natalie Goldberg)

**Writing Goals:**

* **Quantity:** Same as last month. **500-1,000 words a day**, either on my computer or in my notebook. **OR:** if it seems I am hand-writing more in my notebook, (words which I refuse to count) then at least **60 journal pages** will suffice.
* **Of the type:** Two of my favorite books last month were about writing; **Bird by Bird** and **Wild Mind**. Both  were so encouraging. _Bird by Bird_ encouraged me to explore my imagination, what's sitting there that is waiting to come up? What am I trying to push away that needs to come out? What images and memories haunt me? _I want to write more of that._ _Wild Mind_ encouraged me to make writing more of a _practice._ **__**Less about quality, more about presence, wildness, honesty. Kind of like meditation. _I also want to do more of that_. Last, I want to be funnier in my writing. I am funny when I talk, but when I write, I tend to get so serious, probably too serious. _I want to lighten up a bit in my writing_; make myself and imaginary others laugh.
* **Editing/Finishing:** I'd like to FINISH **Basalt** and send it back out to a bunch of literary mags. It's better than it was in September, but it still needs a little work. I'd like to do some major editing on **Gravity**, get close to finishing it. I think the structure is wrong, and I think it's too serious, too heavy. So much of what I'm writing about is actually hilarious, or was to me when I experienced it, but you'd never know it by reading it. This piece will benefit from my learning to lighten up in writing! I'd also like to go back over **a few poems** and re-work/improve/maybe even finish them. But I want to **focus on Gravity and Basalt**; _these pieces need to get done_. I think once they're finished, my imagination will feel freed up to move onto other ideas and stories.

OK: Now off to start working toward these goals!

Love, Katie
