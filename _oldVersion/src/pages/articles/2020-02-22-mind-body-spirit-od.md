This month, my writing and reading goals have gotten a tad sidelined. Not completely, but they've certainly changed form. I completed most of my required reading for February, but not all. I decided I really wasn't in the mood for fiction, and so put the two fiction books back on the shelf for a little while. And my "dating situation" fell apart (again) which caused me to kind of fall apart--because: why!? Why does this keep happening? Last: my back/hip injury had hardly improved, causing me discomfort, misery, and anxiety. 2020 was NOT getting off the start I'd hoped it would!

This prompted me to re-examine some things in my life, and my heart. Coupled with the spiritual reading already assigned to myself for this month, I felt a sudden urge to dive in, whole-heartedly, into a quest for balance, for answers, for greater peace and healing.

None of this is bad. In fact, I think it's very good. But sometimes I can go overboard, and the books and "self-improvement" tasks start to pile up around me, causing, as you may imagine, even more anxiety. Not only because I'm giving myself too much to do, but because this work is hard. Looking inward, deeply, into all areas, light and dark, of the self isn't easy, or cozy, or comfortable. So doing too much of this work, too fast, can do more harm than good: it becomes, for me at least, overwhelming, crushing, and just plain sad.

So I've scaled back. Only one book on the mind or heart or psychology at a time! Only one yoga book at a time! And make time for literature: stories, novels, poems. There is learning and feeling and awakening to be done in those places, too. As for writing, the journaling I'm doing is helpful in engaging more fully in my health and healing, but so is creative writing. I mustn't stop editing my essays and poems, or writing new ones, for the sake of only hard-core journaling. Overdoing anything never helps. Something that hasn't been easy for me to remember.

I think I will scale back in posting on here, too. I saw it at first as a sign of failure, but recently, I actually think it is OK: I'm still writing and reading a lot. Writing on here takes away from writing other things. I will continue to share goals, achievements, insights, or anything interesting I find along the way, but I won't adhere to the requirement of "x" number of posts per months. Books read and pages written? Absolutely still numbers I'm interested in and indeed tracking (and have already exceeded my minimum goals for February. Woo!).

Until next time!

Love, Katie
