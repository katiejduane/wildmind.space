I'm making this website for **accountability** purposes. I have too many interests, curiosities, and ideas, and while this isn't inherently a _bad_ thing, it can (and usually does, for me) lead to starting things without finishing them, as well as endless outward expansion, rather than building upward into something real or concrete. I'd like to honor my wild mind by exploring the many things that interest me _and_ employing all my creative abilities, but I need to harness it all so that what I make doesn't feel like endless wheel spinning, or like a sprawling foundation that merely sinks into the swamp from which it is being built, rather than soaring above it.

Work and goals will follow a monthly/yearly interval, and I'll kind of treat this space like a personal classroom. I'll share writing exercises, sketches, finished drawings and paintings, excerpts of finished writing pieces, as well as goal progress, research for projects, and actual study: I'll read and write about craft, technique, art and literary criticism. I'd also like to include links to or examples of work that very much inspires me; contempoary or historical.
