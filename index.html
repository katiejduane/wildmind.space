    <h1>what is wild mind? why .space?</h1>
    <p>
      well hello! wild mind is katie duane's personal development space for all
      things creative. she chose the domain "wild mind" simply because that best
      describes her mind type. it is all over the place, and not always in a
      "bad" way: she is curious about and loves everything from flowers and
      rocks to learning about ancient ice sheets, asteroid composition, lunar
      history, the meanings of colors, and ...more.

      she usually attempts to express this wide-ranging curiosity through the
      making of art: be it visual or written, and sometime via projects on the
      web too! Obviously, this one is in its infancy, and rather hideous atm.
      It'll get there, and when it does, it will be her home on the web for
      writing and sharing: thoughts, drawings, works-in-progress, and
      published/polished pieces, as they trickle in. she chose .space because
      she loves outer space, wide-open spaces, and is a little spacey, herself.
      her father used to refer to her as "space cadet", and ask whether she was
      on pluto, or earth :)

    <p>come back soon! cheers!</p>
