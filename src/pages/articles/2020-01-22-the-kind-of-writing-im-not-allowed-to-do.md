Whenever I am tempted to read through old journals or blogs, wanting to not only revisit old memories, but also hunt for patterns, there is always one pattern, one kind of writing, I seem to stumble upon. And that is: _meta-writing._ As in, writing about writing. Or to remove myself even further from the terrifying process, writing about why I _think_ I'm not writing. As if that will get me anywhere or propel me forward into purposeful work. It never has. It never will. Even this counts, so I'll keep this post short. It is inspired by some realizations I've made recently in my daily writing practice, which, despite being directionless, is actual writing, so, going well. I've got a lot to vomit up. But this post is also inspired by an old blog post I re-read, from perhaps seven or so years ago. I'd written it before, in other words, and I've written it since. I'd like to vow to never write it again. 



> I worry, though, that I have a problem. I worry that, instead of building upward, I'm building outward. I worry that I'm laying blocks side by side, creating a sprawling, shallow structure that will undoubtedly sink into the mud and disappear. I mean, that's almost always been my tendency. I have too many interest, too many shiny things that catch my attention. It's my hope that I can piece all these things together, watercolor with words, noble gases with neuroses, facts with feelings. I mean, I don't see any other way: whenever I try to decide, whenever I try to pick one thing and follow it, whether it be "writing poetry", or "water color painting" or "teaching", or WHATEVER, I feel suddenly, quite small. Like a slice of pie, rather than the whole pie, longing for its neighbors, for the length of crust across the entire glass dish, for all of the filling, the fruits, the piles of whipped cream.



I think a lot of the endless circling is fear. Fear of failure, of producing ugliness, of not being good enough, of being nothing, no one, never succeeding at anything I really hope to in life. Some of the endless circling really _is_ my wide and bubbling attention span and interest in the world and modes of expression. But I've cut teaching out of my life, I've accepted that for now, the visual artistic practice comes secondary to my writing (though that could change in the semi-distant future). The only thing really left to cut through is the fear and trepidation. Stop writing about writing, thinking about thinking. And just fucking do it. No matter what comes out. I think I'm finally on that path. I have no idea why it took me so long to get here, but I'm not going to waste any more time trying to figure that one out. I can do that once I'm writing for real again, not little shards here and there when I'm in the mood, or otherwise musing endlessly, spinning my wheels against a white wall, rather desperately craning my neck to look behind me, out the window.



Love, Katie
