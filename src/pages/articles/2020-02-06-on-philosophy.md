Quotes like the one in the description of this post are why I felt like I _needed_ to read Seneca's _On the Shortness of Life_. 

And truth be told, I found that much of what Seneca (and Marcus Aurelius, another one of this month's reading assignments) had to say resonated with me, rang true, and made me think and consider new ideas. But it also made me feel terrible; like I was being lectured, possibly even insulted, and for sure the tone was one of condescension. I gave up on Seneca when I got to section of the book titled _Consolation to Helvia_. Helvia was his mother, and, he having been condemned by Caligula (who eventually demanded Seneca's suicide), she _did_ need to be consoled. But I couldn't bear reading it, and I think if anyone ever sent me a letter of consolation written like that, I'd be tempted to rip it to shreds. Nothing he said or pointed out was incorrect, it was simply _how_ he said it. He regarded only his mother's strength, and not her weaknesses, her soft spots; his tone was not one that allowed her to be a vast and complex human. There was very little compassion from him. I have, at this point in my life, tired of listening to and reading voices that lack compassion--it is already lacking in so many places; I don't want it to invade my reading, nor my relationships.

Marcus Aurelius, also undoubtedly wise, similarly lacked a tone of kindness, compassion, understanding in his book _Meditations_. I learned from reading him, as I learned from Seneca, but I did not feel myself growing. The learning was entirely cognitive, it didn't spread into the rest of my being. Having read dozens books you could call "philosophical" in nature, I know how it feels when the learning is being digested, when it is actually changing me somehow.

So: I stopped. I read about half of the Seneca book I assigned myself and about half of the Aurelius book. I don't feel bad about stopping, or like I'm not meeting this month's reading goal. Part of my reading goals is the ability to better to discern what to read so unread books don't keep piling up around my apartment. Hard-core philosophy books, I am discovering, are books I want to read, books I like, in theory, but not in practice. So I can quit trying to make myself read philosophy. I can take those off my shelf, and move onto other realms. There are already far too many books I want to read; no sense in forcing myself to read books I don't want to read.

The _Consolations of Philosophy_, however, is a very kind, and loving book. But it's written by someone alive today, aware of humans to day, and with compassion. He writes about and references/quotes many famous philosophers (including Seneca), but his tone is different, his awareness of humanity kinder, lighter, more humorous. I loved that philosophy book, but I think that it may well be the only one. Maybe someday when I too am older and wiser, I will be able to return to philosophy. But for the time being: onto reading more books, and discerning what books I love, and what to keep reading!
