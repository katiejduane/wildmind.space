I was sitting before one of my bookshelves last night going through all the books, deciding which ones to keep, which ones to donate. Part of my directionless-ness is the consequence of having too many paths to choose from, as both a maker and a learner. I feel tremendous pressure to read all my books, but also paralyzed by the sheer number of choices. In skimming one of the books (I ended up choosing to discard it) I came across an anecdote where the author decided to attempt a minimalist wardrobe for one year. Gray pants, black shirt, every day for 365 days. Her other clothes were donated or bagged up and stowed away for January 1 of the following year, and she disallowed herself from buying anything new.

This experiment intrigued me, but less in the clothing department and more in the information hoarding department. Namely: books. She inspired me to go through the rest of my shelves and get rid of more books I was probably never going to read. I also re-ordered the shelves into _books-I've-read_ and _books-I've-not-read_. And this morning, upon waking up and looking over the bookshelves from my bed, I was inspired to make another decision: _**I'm not allowed to buy any books for one year**_. For all of 2020, I am forbidden from adding to my collection (with a few exotic exceptions: say I'm in Italy in this quirky bookshop and find a great out-of-print art book from the 1960's? I'd let myself buy that). If someone buys me a book as a gift, wonderful! I love book gifts. But I'm not allowed to grow my collection; I've got to learn to say NO to my impulse for more books, more information, more options. 

I**nstead: I want to finally make a dent in reading my current collection.** I'm doubtful I can read all the unread books in 2020, but I can make healthy progress. I also think this will benefit my writing practice and general creativity because I'll be either reading good literature or creating new knowledge, instead of trying to decide what to read or reading 18 books at once and getting nowhere. Additionally, many of the books are about the craft of writing or an artistic practice. All good stuff.

**Books To Read/Finish in January:**

1. The Lost Continent, by Bill Byrson (finish, I'm already almost done)
2. Getting There, edited by Gillian Z. Segal
3. The Creative Habit, by Twyla Tharp (this one also requires I do various activities and set short-term goals, some of which I'm sure I'll share here)
4. Ordinary Genius, by Kim Addonizio (finish)
5. Singing School, by Robert Pinsky _(I may not finish this as I think it's meant to be read slowly and over a long period of time)_
6. Wild Mind, by Natalie Goldberg
7. Gratitude, by Oliver Sacks
8. The Poet's Companion, by Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux _(also may not be able to read this in one month, as there are many paired lessons/exercises/things to reflect upon)_
9. After Nature, by W.G. Sebald
10. Day Book, by Anne Truitt
11. Bird by Bird, by Anne Lamott
12. Year of the Monkey, by Patti Smith

I recognize this is a lot of reading... but I have a lot of reading to do! There is much to learn, absorb, and feel. And I've done a terrible job of being a good reader for a long time. I've read a lot, but not cover-to-cover. I think I can finish all the reading above on one month, or at least come close! At the close of January, I'll report back with an annotated list, revealing what I've completed, or how close I've come. I'm sure I will also dabble in poetry anthologies, reading poems here and there but not finishing any of them completely. I'll make note of poems/poets read at the end of the month.

This also means I'll be writing less for now. I'm OK with this this. I think it's time for more receptivity rather than action (as a writer) as well as exposure and learning. It also means I can focus my creativity more in the realm of drawing and painting, which I'm excited about. It is rare I feel completely right at at home in the world, but whenever I draw or paint, I always feel like I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing. I want to learn more about what that feeling means, where it comes from, what it's pointing toward. And I still think 'success' for me hovers in some unknown territory in my mind where I figure out how to fuse my writing and drawing into single pieces, or separate but bound pieces. I can't get there without drawing more and figuring out where my writing fits in. 

Anyway. Time to read!!

Love, Katie
