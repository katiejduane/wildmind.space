I'd eventually like to have more 'interesting' goals, but for those to float down into my mind from the ether, I need to follow some concrete goals to fruition first. The issues I have with creating actual progress are:

- I try to do too many things at once
- I have a hard time giving my ideas structure (so inevitably, they fall apart, or stay mush)
- I start things, get distracted by new ideas, and don't finish things
- I struggle to create measurable goals I can track

Probably, I'll always struggle with finishing things. Probably, I'll always struggle with wanting to do too many things at once. But these struggles, I think, will be softened and contained by a better ability to create goals I can measure, follow, and complete. Starting with something like numbers and volume seems like a good idea to me, which I think will lead to sturdier, more structured ideas for goals in the future. But for now, I need simple and concrete:

## GOALS for 2020

- Fifteen posts per month
- All categories must be covered once per month (at least)
  - Writing, Art, Research, Goals, Study (these categories may be adjusted/added to in the future)
- One finished drawing or painting per month (I'll share it)
- One finished essay or poem per month (I'll share an except, as well as submit it to various literary magazines)

I think that's a good place to start!!

Love, Katie
