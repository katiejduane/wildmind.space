While this blog is oriented toward my creative exploration and learning, I do sometimes think there are abundant ties between the mental and the physical. In short--the state of my body has an impact on the state of my mind, and the progress I make in my creative work. 

Another goal of mine in the New Year has been to finally adhere to some kind of fitness/wellness regime. I'm famous for starting/stopping yoga, running, biking, weight training, meditating, whatever. And while I'm permitting myself to stop (pause!) running until it's a bit warmer out, I'm not allowed to pause taking care of myself. Which for now means starting workouts at home, and continued yoga practice.

Yoga, for me, has historically been about finding the edges and seeing if I can expand them, and also about simply learning to be more fully in my body, and in the moment. And these are fine points of focus in yoga. But recently, an annoying and persistent hip flexor injury has limited, somewhat severely, what kinds of poses I can do and especially how I do them. While this narrows the breadth of what is available to me in yoga, it also opens up new areas for exploration. Namely: _small spaces_.

Like: why have my quadriceps always been soooo insanely tight? Even as a child, when I was a gymnast, it was an obviously restricted area. The backs of my ankles and tops of my hamstrings, as well as my outer hips, are also famously tight regions of muscle. The same goes for any sort or rotational flexibility in my shoulders. So instead of feeling annoyed that I can no longer do child's pose (and other very basic postures cramped by this terribly convenient hip flexor injury), I can explore and investigate these areas of long-term tension and tightness. Can I loosen them up? Create more space? What happens if I do? Will I feel different? How? Am I possible holding onto things in these parts of my body? What impact will it have on my mind, or how I feel day-to-day, to be more open in these areas of my body?

This isn't something I'll frequently catalog on this blog, but as my overall health and well-being obviously plays a role on my mental/emotional state, as well as my creativity and productivity, I'll write about any findings that are of interest.

Love, Katie
