As stated in a previous post, I had some existential and relational experiences this past month that sent me kinda head-long into spiritual, psychological, and philosophical texts. I totally abandoned fiction. And the moss book, well, it just became too sentimental, and was making me gag. I wanted to love it, but just couldn't. I also started several other books that I have yet to finish, and they will be on the docket for March, though my March goals will focus more on a specific type of writing rather than just volume and lots of reading.



**Writing:**

I didn't have a word count for this month, as the vast majority of my writing was done by hand, in my notebook. But I did write a total of 84 pages in there, plus a few thousand words in blog posts, notes in my writing app, and a few writing exercises done on my computer rather than in my notebook. So I think I indeed met my goal! I also got to a place where I realized I DO in fact know what I want to write, but that I'm simply scared to do it. In March, my goal isn't going to be "write 15,000 words/60 pages of whatever, just be writing!", it's going to be: "Write 15,000 words/60 pages for Blue Straggler" (that's what I've always called this idea as I've been fleshing it out for the past several months, though the name/main concept may change as the project actually unfolds).  Written research will count, as there is a lot to be done. I also nearly finished editing (again) "Basalt" this month. So close! This was a tough month, for me, honestly, for personal reasons. And I want to chastise myself for not doing more, but I think I did OK.
