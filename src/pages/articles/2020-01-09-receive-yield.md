Already I am happy I've chosen to redirect my focus, at the moment, to reading; receiving, rather than forcing action. I so often feel like I'm running out of time that my actions become panicked, uncoordinated, woefully unplanned. Turning off that active switch and devoting myself to receptivity forces (without feeling like force) a lovely byproduct: focus!

A focus on gathering, collecting, learning, receiving, whatever you want to call it. I'm learning from others; I'm learning both new knowledge and new style. I'm pausing trying to create things I think are 'good enough' and instead allowing myself to take it all in. Read all the books I felt like I didn't have time for, or worried would be less useful that purposeful action, let others' ideas enter my brain and mix with the whirl of thoughts and ideas and worries that already reside there. I'm letting myself enjoy fiction again! Novels and short stories. For so long my reading had to serve a 'purpose', had to teach me about writing, or a topic of research. It's nice to just get lost in stories again, other world's created in someone's mind, and then transported to and recreated in my own! Magic, it is!

Another byproduct of receptivity is reorientation. Taking in information sort of allows me to be a conduit, of sorts. I read other people's imaginings and it reforms my own. It makes me ask new questions, wonder about different things, it makes me think about creating work differently, and for different purposes. I've been thinking about trying my hand at fiction again, something I haven't written in ten or twelve years! Any process that allows for internal recalibration is a good one, and while I didn't expect that focusing on reading to change much, I'm glad that it is.

What is received, gently and without force, can then perhaps be _yielded_. Given away freely and joyously. It makes the creative process less self-oriented, less about ago, more about generating and sharing and connecting. At least for me. I'm excited about what this reorientation will bring! Now, back to reading...
