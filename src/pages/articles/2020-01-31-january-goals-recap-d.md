Did I meet my goals for this month? Did I learn anything essential? How am I different now from January 1?

**Reading Goals:** 

**Books To Read/Finish in January:**

1. ~~The Lost Continent, by Bill Byrson~~
2. ~~Getting There, edited by Gillian Z. Segal~~
3. ~~The Creative Habit, by Twyla Tharp~~
4. ~~Ordinary Genius, by Kim Addonizio~~
5. ~~Singing~~ School, by Robert Pinsky _(I anticipated I may not finish this one, as it begs a kind of slow approach, it'll remain in my reading rotation until I finish it.)_
6. ~~Wild Mind, by Natalie Goldberg~~
7. ~~Gratitude, by Oliver Sacks~~
8. The Poetâ€™s Companion, by Kim Addonizio and Dorianne Laux _(I didn't even touch this one, feeling like I needed a break from reading about poetry for a little while)_
9. ~~Aft~~er Nature, by W.G. Sebald _(I couldn't really get into this. I tried, but I wasn't feeling it. I'll take a look at it again someday; I think perhaps now is just not the right time)_
10. Day Book, by Anne Truitt (I started this several years ago and am about a third of the way through. 
11. ~~Bird by Bird, by Anne Lamott~~
12. ~~Year of the Monkey, by Patti Smith~~
13. ~~Attached, by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller~~

**Writing/Blogging Goals:**

* **Posts this month:** 10 (goal met!)
* **Words written:** 9,986, on the computer. Obviously, what's written in my paper journal, I did not count. This is a bit low. I'm aiming for 15,000-30,000 words per month, tho obviously many will go uncounted, as I'm not counting what I write down!
* I didn't cover all **categories** for posts this month; there were none about art.
* I didn't do a **finished drawing** or painting.
* I did not **finish any essays or poems**, though I did do quite a bit of editing.

But, January on the whole was a bit of a mess. I seriously injured my back January 7th. I was then bed-ridden for about five days, and even now, three weeks later, sitting at a desk hunched over to draw is out of the question. I did get a new desk though, which has a section that raises so I won't have to hunch so much! But honestly drawing/painting will probably take a bit of a backseat for a while. **I am trying to be more focused, and my focus is words. Reading them, and writing them.** 

Still, not bad for my first month! Now, onto February!
