I didn't do as much writing as I did editing. A few weeks ago, I got a fantastic rejection letter; as in, it included personalized feedback on the essay I'd submitted. This weekend, having gone up into the mountains to spend a couple days in a quiet cabin, I set to work on taking her criticism and using it to make the piece better. While I'm still not totally finished, the current draft is much stronger than the version I sent out to magazines. I'm so grateful this woman took the time to send me her thoughts.

I also re-read and started to move around pieces in another essay I've been working on for far too long. I was kind of beating myself up about my slow progress this past year, but then I remembered: I _was_ busy changing careers, too. That ate up nearly all my time and energy from November 2018-July 2019. Since August, I've been back at writing quite frequently, thought I do still think I could do better, and am working on establishing some rituals and routines that will help me stay on track.

Initially, I thought pure volume was the answer. And I think to a degree, it might be. But other days, I think it's OK to write less if I'm busy editing a piece. And this weekend, I wrote only a little, but edited a lot. I think this is OK. I actually think once I finally finish these two pieces, I'll free up a lot of mental space to being ideating about something new to work on, rather than only just writing whatever pops into my mind, or from a  prompt/exercise. I want to keep doing these things, but following ideas is fun, too.

I also had a bit of a meltdown yesterday morning. An on-going project for me these past few months has been culling my blog, which had entries from 2009-2018. I wanted to copy/paste most of them into a file. But it was tedious, so it's been on and off for months. This weekend, I tackled the end of it. The near end, years 2013-2016 was the worst. It was hard to read, to relive. The amount of denial I was not only experiencing, but expressing, trying to convince myself of, was so utterly depressing, maddening even. It made me sick to see myself stuck in the same circular pattern for years. It's honestly been nearly a decade of this wheel-spinning, meta-thinking, meta-writing pattern, but 2013-16 were the worst of it. I was so ashamed of myself and nearly threw the whole project away, desiring to delete the blog and erase this pathetic person I'd been, but something urged me to press on. 

And by the time I got to 2017 I realized why. I did get out of that pattern. I still haven't gotten it all figured out yet, but the denial is over. It was refreshing to read my thoughts when they weren't laced with thick bands of denial. It was heartening to read my express my fears in making scary life-changes, as well as the joys and freedoms I experienced having left the classroom and felt that weight lift from my shoulders. Then I saw myself think about going back to school, and then decide to do it: the pull the trigger on a new career path I could never have imagined before.

Ironically, perfectly, the last post I ever wrote in that blog was in September 2018 (just a couple months before going back to school), and  was titled "The Exploding Pattern". It chronicled the patterns I hunted for the forever eluded me, and also the patterns, both good and bad, that haunted me, and that I also conveniently ignored. I concluded that I needed a self-created pattern, one I was in "control" of: a daily ritual, time dedicated, every day, to writing, or some creative act. I was still obsessed with patterns then, so I made it about that. I'm less concerned, now, with finding meaning in it all, revealing some intricate pattern, but I was right to assume I needed a daily habit (besides coffee). I couldn't manage it when I was back in school and then job hunting full time. But I can manage it now. And so far, despite the difficulties and injuries January has brought me, I've mostly stuck to it. I can only assume February will be even better!

On the last day of the month, I'll post a final time, going over the goals I set and achieved! I'm looking forward to it; I've almost done it all.

To finish, a quote from the final days of my old blog, a moment of clarity about 'pattern-hunting':a little 'note' I wrote myself:

> Looking is often futile, I think. Whether or not there is some great mysterious pattern, what _is_ certain is that jumping the gun rarely serves us. What I need to cultivate is greater patience, a willingness to sit through the storms, through the ugly mess, through the senseless times. While I strongly believe that there is a lesson in everything, I also need to accept the fact that sometimes: we just fuck up. We make mistakes and we have to live with them. They don’t all point us toward some glittering jewel we don’t know exists. Some of the mistakes are minor, easily fixable, forgettable even. But some mistakes change the course of our lives, some hurt us for a long time, or hurt others, some make things difficult for us for years, some we must look back on as a mistake–however trivial or grave–and not some roadblock that redirected us toward a superior destiny. It’s wishful thinking, and, for me at least, it’s too easy. I’m rarely partial toward what’s easiest.

And a little 'note' I wrote myself:

> ‘Getting there’ is not the goal, instead: strive for constant arrival. It is what allows every day to feel like a gift, it is what makes mystery gorgeous, it is what makes you creative, generative, and ecstatic about being alive. Because there is no longer a final destination, life feels like an unfinished map without borders, brimming with infinite possibility. You get to design the landscape, the roads, the intersections and roundabouts, piece by piece, in any direction and style you choose.
