I didn't love everything about this book (namely: despite Twyla Tharp's obvious intelligence, talent, and success, I still thought she generalized too much, leapt to conclusions that seemed a little to simple/easy for my taste). But that aside, there was a LOT to be learned from this book. I highlighted and underlined a lot. Here are a few gems I'd like to remember and share:

1. The "Creative Autobiography" alone makes the book worth reading. Thirty-three questions that make you **think about why you want to create**, how you create, what you're afraid of, what inspires you, and what stops you.
2. The idea of **muscle memory** as a means of practice. With regards to writing: even the simple act of typing someone else's words (a beloved poem or story perhaps) is good "exercise". Getting the body moving gets the mind moving. _\[New goal: share a favorite poem each week!]_
3. "Scratching" is her word for brainstorming, hunting for or generating ideas. She recommends scratching for **small ideas** rather than big ideas, and then stitching those small ideas together. A good idea should turn you on rather than shut you off. You generate the idea, retain the idea, inspect the idea, and then _transform_ the idea.
4. Accidents will happen! There is good planning and then there is over-planning; think of a good plan as a partial map. It must allow for a suddenly altered landscape. She also says that **luck is a skill**. Those of us who are working away everyday, who are ready, are the ones available for luck to "bite us on the nose".
5. The idea of a **spine** might have been the most helpful to me, being the queen of projects that get lost, lack sense of direction, and are never finished. Spine is the answer to the question: **"what am I trying to say?"** Spine guides a piece, it is the reason for its generation, though it may not be overtly visible in the finished work. Getting lost on occasion is OK, but floating "spinelessly" will get you only so far. This truth I know all too well. 
6. Skill is necessary. You can only express something to the degree your skills will allow. Creativity cannot come before **craft**!
7. Ruts and grooves are two sides of the same coin. I know ruts all too well: the **land of wheel-spinning**, action without movement or accretion. It isn't block, and is often the result of a bad idea, bad timing, losing one's 'spine', a wrong turn with a good idea, or sticking to tried and true methods when perhaps something new or different is warranted. A groove, on the other hand, feels like the best place in the world: a straight and narrow creative path without pauses or hitches!
8. Don't be a one trick pony, she insists, nor a flash in the pan. Learn to fail gracefully, learn from failures, and get better and grow with experience.
