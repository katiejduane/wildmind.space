what is wild mind? why .space?

hello! wild mind is katie duane's personal development space for all
things creative. I chose the domain "wild mind" simply because that best
describes her mind type. it is all over the place, and not always in a
"bad" way: I am curious about and love everything from flowers and rocks
to learning about ancient ice sheets, asteroid composition, lunar history,
the meanings of colors, and ...more.

I usually attempt to express this wide-ranging curiosity through the
making of art: be it visual or written, and sometime via projects on the
web too! Obviously, this one is in its infancy, and rather hideous atm.
It'll get there, and when it does, it will be my casita on the web for
writing and sharing: thoughts, drawings, works-in-progress, and
published/polished pieces, as they trickle in. I chose .space because I
love outer space, wide-open spaces, and is a little spacey, myself. my
father used to refer to me as "space cadet", and ask whether I was on
pluto, or earth.

come back soon! cheers!
